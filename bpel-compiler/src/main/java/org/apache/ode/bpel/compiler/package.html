    <p>BPEL compiler (bpelc) classes and interfaces.
    Taking as input the de-referenced BPEL object model
    (see {@link org.apache.ode.bom.impl.nodes}), the BPEL compiler applies
    static analysis rules to ensure compliance of the BPEL model.
    Upon successful analysis, the compiler generates a
    &quot;compiled&quot; process description suitable for
    consumption by the BPEL Service Provider?s
    (see {@link com.fs.jlo.bpel.provider.BpelServiceProvider})
    processing engine (also known as the virtual processing unit
    or <b>VPU</b>).</p>

    <p>Failures in the static analysis phase are
    reported in the same manner as parser errors and contain
    detailed error descriptions and line number references to
    the location of the errors in the original BPEL XML process
    definition.</p>
